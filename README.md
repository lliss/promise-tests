# Promise Experiments

A demo project for helping learn and teach about ES6 promises.

These tests require ES6 browser support. A recent version of Chrome or Firefox should work fine.

The demo includes a server that helps process some data to provide real async functionality.

Code will assume that your demo server is on port `localhost:8001`.

### Usage

Use the `site` directory to host a local instance of the site. You'll need to actually run the demo site through a server or else much of the JS functionality will not work.

The easiest way to do this is to change into the site directory and then run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` which will start a server the current directory on `localhost:8000`.
